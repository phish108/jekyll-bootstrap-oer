Jekyll Theme based on Bootstrap for Open Educational Resources

##Â Motivation

I was looking for a simple, yet elegant theme for learning materials that can be used for online resources as well as for print material. The idea is to have a single set of markdown documents that are the source for online as well as print material.

## Idea of the concept

As an author of educational material I have three primary interests: 

1. Focus on the learning resources.
2. Allow any part of a resource to be versionable.
3. Have a common source for print and online presentation.
